## Project Specifications

For this project, i will be forecasting real estate prices of various zipcodes using data from [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). However, this won't be as straightforward as just running a time-series analysis--i'm gonna  have to make some data-driven decisions and think critically along the way!

### The Project

For this project, i'll try to Answer this following question:

> what are the top 5 best zipcodes for us to invest in the US?

This may seem like a simple question at first glance, but there's more than a little ambiguity here that we'll have to think through in order to provide a solid recommendation. Should our recommendation be focused on profit margins only? What about risk? What sort of time horizon are we predicting against? 

## GOAL

The goal of this project is to  complete a very common real-world task in regard to Time-Series Modeling. However, real world problems often come with a significant degree of ambiguity, which requires  knowledge of statistics and data science to think critically about and answer. While the main task in this project is Time-Series Modeling, that isn't the overall goal--it is important to understand that Time-Series Modeling is a tool in our toolbox, and the forecasts it provides us are what we'll use to answer important questions.
